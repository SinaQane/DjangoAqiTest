# DjangoAQI
Couldn't make this private, so I'll just make my first Django training code public. Please ignore it and walk away...


The code uses the data from https://www.airnow.gov/ web page. You can get your own TOKEN from https://docs.airnowapi.org/

It can search for the O3 AQI level of an area using your US ZipCode (Unfortunately it only works in the United States).

It is part of Codemy Django Course's projects, so nothing is really mine...
